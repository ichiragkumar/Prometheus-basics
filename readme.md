Types of metrics in Prometheus
- Counter
- Gauge
- Histogram


## Counter
    A counter is a cumulative metric that only increases.
    Example: Counting the number of HTTP requests.
    Gauge

    ## Counters
    Letâ€™s add logic to count the number of requests (throughput) of our application.

    ```bash
    npm install prom-client
    ```

    ### create a file  metrics/requestCount.ts
    and add these sort of 
    import { NextFunction, Request, Response } from "express";
import client from "prom-client";

// Create a counter metric
const requestCounter = new client.Counter({
    name: 'http_requests_total',
    help: 'Total number of HTTP requests',
    labelNames: ['method', 'route', 'status_code']
});

export const requestCountMiddleware = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    const startTime = Date.now();

    res.on('finish', () => {
        const endTime = Date.now();
        console.log(`Request took ${endTime - startTime}ms`);

        // Increment request counter
        requestCounter.inc({
            method: req.method,
            route: req.route ? req.route.path : req.path,
            status_code: res.statusCode
        });
    });

    next();
};






## Gauge   
    A gauge is a metric that can go up and down. It can be used to measure values that fluctuate, such as the current number of active users or the current memory usage.
    Example: Measuring the current memory usage
## Histogram
    A histogram samples observations (usually things like request durations or response sizes) and counts them in configurable buckets. It also provides a sum of all observed values.
    Example: Measuring the duration of HTTP requests.
